# This is Sky of Grind, a gregified minecraft modpack for beginners and experienced players that want to enjoy a hard but rewarding gameplay.
 Modernized Skyblock GregTech Modpack

 Even though this is a skyblock. You will never be sifting for resources, instead dive into new mods like the Extractinator to generate items on the early game.
 Make processing lines for ores on midgame and enjoy a fully gregified blood magic without the boring and rng things like the hidden realm. Only gregtech multiblocks.

 MINIMUM 4 GB; Recommended is 8.

 This pack is in BETA and is only playable up to UHV tier. Join the official discord to see current dev work/progress and get support [HERE](https://discord.gg/ECsQ5xkUYw).
